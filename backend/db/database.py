# database.py
# Async SQLAlchemy engine + session factory for Neon Postgres.
#
# This is a SEPARATE store from Qdrant. Qdrant still holds vectors/chunks.
# This DB holds relational data: users, document ownership, conversations, messages.
#
# DATABASE_URL comes from .env — get it from the Neon dashboard's "Connection string"
# (use the "Pooled connection" string, not the direct one — HF Spaces containers
# open/close connections frequently, and Neon's pooler handles that better than
# a direct connection would under repeated cold starts).
#
# IMPORTANT: Neon's connection string starts with "postgresql://" — SQLAlchemy's
# async engine needs the asyncpg driver spelled out explicitly, or it'll try to
# use the sync psycopg2 driver and fail. We rewrite the scheme below so you can
# paste Neon's string as-is into .env without editing it by hand.
